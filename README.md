# candevproject

This project was developed in a team of four during CANDEV Data Challenge and devoted to help depict the ever-changing landscape of Government funding to businesses.

The data is collected from two datasets including Proactive Disclosure-grants and contributions and Detailed information on Transfer Payments. We found the useful data from the mass datasets, and stored the useful data into MySQL for further analysis and future analysis. After extracting the data features in Python, we developed the data visualization with Python plotly.
